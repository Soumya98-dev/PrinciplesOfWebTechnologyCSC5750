    <p class="bio">My interest in software creation and problem-solving began when I was introduced to Java programming. I was
        fascinated by how a few lines of code could answer the most difficult real-life problems, and my curiosity led
        me to Heritage, where I majored in Computer Science. To connect the dots, I am continually studying new
        programming languages (Python, SQL, React, Java, JavaScript), algorithms, and mathematics. Currently, I am
        pursuing my Masters in Computer Science in Wayne State University, Detroit.
