    <p>My interest in software creation and problem-solving began when I was introduced to Java programming. I was
        fascinated by how a few lines of code could answer the most difficult real-life problems, and my curiosity led
        me to Heritage, where I majored in Computer Science. To connect the dots, I am continually studying new
        programming languages (Python, SQL, React, Java, JavaScript), algorithms, and mathematics. Currently, I am
        pursuing my Masters in Computer Science in Wayne State University, Detroit.</p>

            <td>The goal of the course is to present a basic introduction to database management systems, with an
                emphasis on database design methodologies (ER diagrams), the relational model, and database query
                languages (relational algebra and SQL), normalization theory, physical data organization and indexing,
                query processing and optimization, and an introduction no NO-SQL database systems. Students will design
                and implement a web-based database system to deepen their understanding of the basic database concepts
                and theories. After taking this course, students will have the capability for developing various
                database systems, such as enterprise information systems, e-commerce websites, business management
                systems. This course will provide a solid foundation for more advanced topics for database managements
                systems, such as transaction processing, NO-SQL, and blockchain-based apps.
