                <td>The goal of the course is to present a basic introduction to database management systems, with an
                    emphasis on database design methodologies (ER diagrams), the relational model, and database query
                    languages (relational algebra and SQL), normalization theory, physical data organization and indexing,
                    query processing and optimization, and an introduction no NO-SQL database systems. Students will design
                    and implement a web-based database system to deepen their understanding of the basic database concepts
                    and theories. After taking this course, students will have the capability for developing various
                    database systems, such as enterprise information systems, e-commerce websites, business management
                    systems. This course will provide a solid foundation for more advanced topics for database managements
                    systems, such as transaction processing, NO-SQL, and blockchain-based apps.
